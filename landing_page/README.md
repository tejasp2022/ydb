# Your Daily Briefing: Personalized AI-Powered Podcasts

## Overview

Morning With Mo (MWM) creates a personalized daily (or customizable) podcast experience. Think of it as a "Morning Brew" meets an AI radio host, offering content curated around your specific interests. Whether it's your favorite sports teams, stock market updates, TV shows, or niche topics, this service generates an audio podcast that's tailored just for you.

## Features

- **Personalized Content**: Curate your content sources from platforms like LinkedIn, Twitter, Reddit, niche forums, stock market news, and more.
- **AI-Generated Hosts**: AI-driven voices (that sound natural) read through the curated content and create a podcast tailored to your interests.
- **Customizable Experience**: Choose your preferred podcast hosts' voices, style, and greeting personalization.
- **Automatic Upload**: Once generated, the podcast is automatically uploaded to your Spotify or another audio platform of choice.
- **On-Demand Listening**: Access your podcast via a mobile app or web browser, without having to sift through newsletters, articles, or irrelevant content.
- **Multilingual Support**: Enjoy your personalized podcasts in multiple languages, making it truly global.

## How It Works

### 1. Personalized Profile
Set up your profile by selecting the content sources you're interested in. Examples include:
- Social Media (LinkedIn, Twitter)
- Niche forums (e.g., Python release notes)
- News outlets, TV show subreddits
- RSS feeds, sports updates

### 2. Content Pipeline
- **Content Aggregation**: The system pulls content from these sources and selects topics that are most relevant to you.
- **AI-Generated Script**: An AI "writer" creates a concise podcast script based on the curated content.
- **AI Voice Generation**: The script is read by a natural-sounding AI voice, which greets you by name and presents the topics in a conversational format.
- **Podcast Delivery**: The final podcast is delivered to your preferred platform (Spotify, Apple Podcasts, etc.).

## Why Build This?

The goal of this project is to provide users with a hyper-personalized and efficient way to stay informed about the things that matter most to them. Instead of wasting time on irrelevant content, this service allows users to get just the news and updates they care about in a digestible, audio format perfect for busy lifestyles.
